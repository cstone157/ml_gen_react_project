# Gemini version of the project
Tying out using gemini to build a react project for me.

    - Gemini struggled to create a correct docker-compose.yml for both mongodb and mongo-express.  It helped to do one at a time, but still wasn't able to get it done.
    - Gemini generated a good server.js for the api, but wasn't able to get the mongodb connect string for mongo-express correct.  Had to manually write it for myself.
