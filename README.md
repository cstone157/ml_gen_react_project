# ml_gen_react_project

- Tying out using different AI/ML to build a react project for me.
- The example project will be a react project, with a node-express backend api, and mongodb.  The project will have a supply table, product table, and an orders table.  It should allow users to add any of the three components.  But if the order for a product, doesn't have sufficent supplies to complete the order and should flag that order and impossible to complete.
